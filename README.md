React SPA served with Firebase.

Config secrets have been removed for security purposes. To use locally, provide your own firebase config to firebase.initializeApp() in the "Home" component's constructor.

The hosted app at the url to the right of the the repo description on GitHub includes these config secrets, and the database calls are working.
